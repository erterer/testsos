# Workshop Continuous Integration

This repository contains everything you need for the workshop Continuous Integration, developed by Ordina JTech for Fontys Hogeschool.

Using Docker we'll spin up a preconfigured build server on your own computer, containing GitLab, Jenkins with Maven, SonarQube and Artifactory.

The Java software we're going to build is also contained in this repository. You can use your favorite IDE and Git client, or edit directly the source code in GitLab. More on that later.

## Preparation

Students visiting Ordina at 21st or 23rd Feb 2018 will receive an USB memory stick containing a VirtualBox image. 
Instructions on how to spin that up will be shipped in a PDF on that stick.

However, if you're reading this page on GitHub, you'll have to do some installation yourself. 
Please follow the instructions on the [Getting Started](https://github.com/Ordina-JTech/fordintysa-ci/wiki/GettingStarted) wiki page of this repository.
